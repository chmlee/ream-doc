There are three versions of REAM and three corresponding implementations:

- REAM v0.1:
[specs](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-lang),
[source](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-python),
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ream/)

- REAM v0.2:
[specs](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-doc-v2),
[source](https://github.com/chmlee/reamparser.js),
[editor](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor-vue)<sup>[1]</sup>

- REAM v0.3:
[specs](/)(this site),
[sourse](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-core),
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ream),
[editor 1](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor)<sup>[2]</sup>,
[editor 2](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-wasm)<sup>[3]</sup>

[1]: I broke some node dependencies, again, and the site is currently not working.

[2]: Seems to work best on Firefox.

[3]: both editor 1 and 2 uses ream-core for parsing.
The only differences are the front-end framework and how front-end and the parser interact.
Editor 1 is based on [Yew](https://yew.rs/docs/en/) and is written entirely in Rust with ream-core as a dependency.
Editor 2 is vanilla JavaScript.
