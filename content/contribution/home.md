This is a free and open source project.
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
You can [email me](mailto:louis@chihminglee.com) your suggestions or create new issues in the relevant repository.

Some of the improvements I plan to make are listed below.

## Documentataion

Source: [https://github.com/chmlee/ream-doc](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-doc)

### Typo and Grammatical Error

### Content reorganization

Documentation content should follow the [Divio Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/) and be reorganized into four parts:

1. tutorials
2. how-to guides
3. technical reference
4. explanation

### Embedded Editor

The embedded editor in this documentation still uses the [v0.2 implementation](https://github.com/chmlee/reamparser.js).
I have yet find a way to port the [WebAssembly version of the v0.3 implementation](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-wasm) into the website.

### Tutorial

The current tutorial is structured more like a reference than a tutorial.
Some of the features I wish to see in a tutorial is:

- introduce just enough concept to create a simple dataset in less than 30 minutes.

- interactive.
Users should be able to test the examples without a local install.
[Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) is my ideal tutorial.

- beginner-friendly.
What is a 64-bit float?
What is an abstract syntax tree?
What is Git?
If I can't provide brief explanations in the tutorial, they don't belong in the tutorial.
