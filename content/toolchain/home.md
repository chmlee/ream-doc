The following tools are developed around REAM.
The goal is to provide a user-friendly workflow to create, edit, distribute and reuse REAM files.

## Alpha

- [ream-core](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-core):
REAM compiler written in Rust.

- [REAM Editor](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor):
a web-based editor for REAM.

- [prism-ream](https://github.com/chmlee/prism):
a fork of syntax highlighting library [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) with REAM support added.
Pull requests may be submitted once the language is stable.

- [ream.vim](https://github.com/chmlee/ream.vim):
syntax highlighting for REAM in Vim.

## Planned

- A package manger inspired by [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

## Not maintained
- [ream-python](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-python):
REAM v0.1 parser and emitter written in Python and [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark).

- [reamparser.js](https://github.com/chmlee/reamparser.js):
REAM v0.2 parser written in JavaScript.
