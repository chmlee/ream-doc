            The project is under active development and is not production ready.
            You are free to play around with the language and tools, but note that backward compatibility is not guaranteed.
            If you are interested in using REAM for serious projects, please

            Migration from the <a href="https://chmlee.github.io/ream-doc">old documentation</a> is a work in progress.
            Not all features are well-documented, and the website needs more polishing.
            See
            <a href="/contribution/note">
                here
            </a>
            for a more detailed discussion.

            REAM is an alternative to spreadsheets and databases for managing social science datasets that emphasizes on maintainability.
            It compiles to both analysis-ready <b>datasets</b> (CSV, JSON) and human-readable <b>documentations</b> (HTML, PDF).
            Multiple formats, one source.
        </p>

            REAM has three main components:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    a <em>data serialization language</em> for structured datasets (working in progress)
                </li>
                <li>
                    a <em>data template</em> for generating datasets (working in progress)
                </li>
                <li>
                    a collection of <em>filters</em> for data manipulation (planned)
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>



        <p>
          The language, along with the <a href="/toolchain">toolchain</a>, aims to help social scientists build human-readable, modular and reusable datasets, ranging from small personal projects to large collaborative projects.
